Various source for the game GreyHack ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/ )

```
trysploit       - Command line tool to try an exploit and get some sense of what category
                  it belongs to before implementing it in code.
ver             - Command line tool to find out version of a file
portscanner     - A basic portscanner. Not needed since NMAP exists in the game, written for fun.
change.passwd   - Generic tool for changing password on hosts.
get.passwd      - Generic tool for getting /etc/passwd from host.
get.shell       - Generic tool for getting a shell on host.
```

(NOTE: Save files in the game as .src, not .lua. I just used .lua to get color markup on GitHub)
