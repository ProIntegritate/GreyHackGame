Various source for the game GreyHack ( https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/ )

```
trysploit - Command line tool to try an exploit and get some sens of category it belongs to before implementing it in code.
ver       - Command line tool to find out version of a file

(NOTE: Save files in the game as .src, not .lua. I just used .lua to get color markup on GitHub)
